* Repositories you've starred and organized into lists.
* An overview of your activity in organizations, repositories, and teams you're most active in.
* Badges and Achievements that highlight your activity and show if you use GitHub Pro or participate in programs like the Arctic Code Vault, GitHub Sponsors, or the GitHub Developer Program.

* Mutual connections you share with someone who is viewing your profile. The person viewing your profile can see which of the people they follow are also followed by you.

You can also set a status on your profile to provide information about your availability.\
You can pin a public repository if you own the repository or you've made contributions to the repository within the last year.

```{note}
Commits to forks don't count as contributions, so you can't pin a fork that you don't own.
```
