### Enterprise Managed Users

::::{grid}
:::{grid-item-card}
What is the purpose of **Enterprise Managed Users** on GitHub Enterprise Cloud ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
To centrally manage identity and access for enterprise members from an external identity provider.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
**Enterprise Managed Users** enables organizations to manage the lifecycle and authentication of users on GitHub.com from an external identity management system, or IdP. It allows organizations to provide access to **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** to people who have existing identities and group membership on their IdP, while centrally controlling usernames, profile data, team membership, and repository access.

Why other options are wrong:
* To allow users to create public content and collaborate with other users.\
{bdg-danger}`Incorrect` This option is incorrect because **Enterprise Managed Users** do not enable users to create public content or collaborate with other users outside the enterprise. It primarily focuses on managing identity and access within the organization.

* To restrict access to enterprise resources and limit user interactions within GitHub.
{bdg-danger}`Incorrect` This option is incorrect because **Enterprise Managed Users** do not restrict access to enterprise resources but rather provide controlled access based on roles and permissions managed by the organization's IdP.

* To automate the creation and management of user accounts on GitHub.com.
{bdg-danger}`Incorrect` This option is incorrect because while **Enterprise Managed Users** facilitates the management of user accounts, it does not automate the creation and management of user accounts on GitHub.com. User accounts are provisioned and managed by the organization's IdP.
