What is the significance of adding labels to a pull request ?
*Choose TWO correct answers.*
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
* It categorizes the nature of the changes being proposed.
* To provide visual clues for the purpose of the pull request.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Labels in a pull request serve as visual clues for the purpose of the pull request, helping maintainers understand the nature of the changes being proposed in a pull request, such as whether it's a bug fix, an enhancement, or related to documentation.\
A maintainer might also add a label or multiple labels.

Some of the labels we use in the repository for this Learn module are:
* Bug (red): Something isn't working
* Documentation (blue): Improvements or additions to documentation
* Duplicate (gray): This issue or pull request already exists
* Enhancement (teal): New feature or request

About saved replies

You can use a saved reply to respond to an issue or pull request.

Saved replies allow you to create a reusable response to issues and pull requests.
Save time by creating a saved reply for the responses you use most frequently.

Once you've added a saved reply, it can be used in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
Saved replies are tied to your personal account.
Once they're created, you'll be able to use them across repositories and organizations.

You can create a maximum of 100 saved replies.
If you've reached the maximum limit, you can delete saved replies that you no longer use or edit existing saved replies.

You can also use the GitHub-provided "Duplicate issue" saved reply to mark an issue as a duplicate and track it with a similar issue.
