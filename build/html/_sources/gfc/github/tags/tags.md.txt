Brian, a developer, is working on a private repository for a proprietary project for his company.\
He wants to organize the repository by adding specific **topics** relevant to the project's technology stack and functionalities.\
What is the visibility status of **topic** names created within a private repository on GitHub ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
* {bdg-success}`Correct` **Topic** names created in private repositories are always public.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
GitHub maintains the visibility of **topic** names as public, regardless of whether they are created within private repositories.
This means that even though the repository itself is private and inaccessible to others, the **topics** associated with it are visible to all GitHub users.

:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Labels in a pull request serve as visual clues for the purpose of the pull request, helping maintainers understand the nature of the changes being proposed in a pull request, such as whether it's a bug fix, an enhancement, or related to documentation.\
A maintainer might also add a label or multiple labels.

Some of the labels we use in the repository for this Learn module are:
* Bug (red): Something isn't working
* Documentation (blue): Improvements or additions to documentation
* Duplicate (gray): This issue or pull request already exists
* Enhancement (teal): New feature or request
