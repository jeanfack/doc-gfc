:::{grid-item-card}
1. Projects can be created at the organization level, independent of any repository.
2. You can link repositories later, so it’s not required during creation.
3. Projects can start from scratch or use a template, so selecting a template is optional.
4. Checklist items can be converted into sub-issues after issues exist.
5. Projects can also be created from repositories, but it is not mandatory.
