What happens if a poll is edited after some votes have been cast ?
:::

The votes are reset, and users need to vote again.

:::{grid-item-card}
You can create polls in the polls category to gauge interest in new ideas and project direction. Anyone with read access to your repository can create polls, vote in polls, and view their results. Signed out users can view the results of polls in public repositories.

Polls require a question and at least two options. You can add a maximum of eight options and the options can contain a maximum of 128 characters.

Voters cannot change their vote. Editing a poll will reset any votes that have already been cast.

## Marking as answer

::::{grid}
:::{grid-item-card}
Can a threaded comment be marked as an answer in a GitHub discussion ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Yes, threaded comments can be marked as answers.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
In GitHub discussions, you can mark a threaded comment (a comment in response to another comment) as the answer to a discussion if it provides a satisfactory solution or response.\
This feature allows for flexibility in acknowledging helpful contributions within the discussion thread.

```{admonition} Example
Imagine a GitHub discussion where a user asks a question about a specific feature in a project, and another user replies with a detailed explanation in a threaded comment.
If the reply effectively addresses the question and resolves any confusion, it can be marked as the answer, even if it's not the original post in the discussion.
```
