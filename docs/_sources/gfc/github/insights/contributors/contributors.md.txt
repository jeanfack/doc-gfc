She wants to troubleshoot the issue.\
What could be a possible reason why Meg's contributions are not appearing in the repository's contributors graph?

If you don't appear in a repository's contributors graph, it may be because:
* You aren't one of the top 100 contributors.
* Your commits haven't been merged into the default branch.
* The email address you used to author the commits isn't connected to your account on GitHub.
