Meg is a developer who has been actively contributing to a GitHub repository, but she notices that her contributions are not showing up in the contributors graph.\
She wants to troubleshoot the issue.\
What could be a possible reason why Meg's contributions are not appearing in the repository's contributors graph?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Meg's commits haven't been merged into the default branch.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
If you don't appear in a repository's contributors graph, it may be because:
* You aren't one of the top 100 contributors.
* Your commits haven't been merged into the default branch.
* The email address you used to author the commits isn't connected to your account on GitHub.

Lois uses GitHub Actions to automate various tasks in her project workflow and recently encountered an issue with one of the actions referenced in her GitHub Actions workflow.\
Where can she view the actions referenced in her GitHub Actions workflows ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
In the Dependency Graph of her repository.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
**Viewing Actions as Dependencies:** When Bob sets up workflows in his GitHub repository, he references specific actions that perform tasks within those workflows. These actions are essentially dependencies for his workflows because they are required to execute the defined tasks. Bob can view these referenced actions as dependencies in the dependency graph of his repository.

**Dependency Graph:** The dependency graph is a visual representation of the dependencies within a repository. It shows the relationships between different elements, such as `packages`, `dependencies`, and in this case, `actions` used in workflows. By navigating to the dependency graph of his repository, Bob can see a clear overview of all the actions referenced in his workflows.

Bob can view the actions referenced in his GitHub Actions workflows as dependencies in the dependency graph of his repository. This allows him to understand the dependencies of his workflows, troubleshoot any issues related to actions, and ensure the overall integrity and security of his automated workflows.

What tool can automatically create pull requests to update dependencies flagged as vulnerable ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
**Dependabot**
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
A dependency alert can lead to a project contributor bumping the offending package reference to the recommended version and creating a pull request for validation. Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to automate this effort? Well, good news! **Dependabot** does just that. It scans for dependency alerts and creates pull requests so that a contributor can validate the update and merge the request.
