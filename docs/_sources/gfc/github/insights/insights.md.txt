Meg is a developer who has been actively contributing to a GitHub repository, but she notices that her contributions are not showing up in the contributors graph.\
She wants to troubleshoot the issue.\
What could be a possible reason why Meg's contributions are not appearing in the repository's contributors graph?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Meg's commits haven't been merged into the default branch.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
If you don't appear in a repository's contributors graph, it may be because:
* You aren't one of the top 100 contributors.
* Your commits haven't been merged into the default branch.
* The email address you used to author the commits isn't connected to your account on GitHub.

She wants to identify all the dependencies her project relies on. Which feature should she use ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Dependency Graph
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Lois can use the Dependency Graph feature on GitHub to identify all the project's dependencies. 
This feature provides a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in the repository and any submitted dependencies. 
It supports various package ecosystems and displays dependencies and dependents, along with license information and vulnerability severity.
