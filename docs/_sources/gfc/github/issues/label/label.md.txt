Labels in a pull request serve as visual clues for the purpose of the pull request, helping maintainers understand the nature of the changes being proposed in a pull request, such as whether it's a bug fix, an enhancement, or related to documentation.\
A maintainer might also add a label or multiple labels.

Some of the labels we use in the repository for this Learn module are:
* Bug (red): Something isn't working
* Documentation (blue): Improvements or additions to documentation
* Duplicate (gray): This issue or pull request already exists
* Enhancement (teal): New feature or request
