What is GitHub Copilot ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that you can use to get code suggestions.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
GitHub Copilot is a service that provides you with an AI pair programmer that works with all of the popular programming languages and dramatically accelerates overall developer productivity.

GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, an AI system created by OpenAI. OpenAI Codex has broad knowledge of how people use code and is more capable than GPT-3 in code generation, in part because it was trained on a data set that includes a larger concentration of public source code.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim/Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

```{note}
GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, which is a better statement than saying GitHub Copilot is OpenAI Codex.
```

:::{grid-item-card}
Code suggestion and generation
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
GitHub Copilot is designed to assist developers by suggesting and generating code in real-time. It draws context from both comments and existing code to offer instantaneous suggestions for individual lines of code or even entire functions. The tool aims to accelerate the coding process, making it faster and more efficient.
