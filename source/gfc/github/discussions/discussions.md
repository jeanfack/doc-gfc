## Marking as answer

::::{grid}
:::{grid-item-card}
Can a threaded comment be marked as an answer in a GitHub discussion ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Yes, threaded comments can be marked as answers.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
In GitHub discussions, you can mark a threaded comment (a comment in response to another comment) as the answer to a discussion if it provides a satisfactory solution or response.\
This feature allows for flexibility in acknowledging helpful contributions within the discussion thread.

```{admonition} Example
Imagine a GitHub discussion where a user asks a question about a specific feature in a project, and another user replies with a detailed explanation in a threaded comment.
If the reply effectively addresses the question and resolves any confusion, it can be marked as the answer, even if it's not the original post in the discussion.
```
