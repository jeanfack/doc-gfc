:::{grid-item-card}
GitHub provides the option to create a permanent link to a specific line or range of lines of code in a file or pull request. This permanent link, known as a permalink, ensures that the shared link remains valid even if changes are made to the file in the future. By using the "Permalink" option, Stewie can generate a URL that directly points to the specific line of code he wants to share with Meg. This link will render as a code snippet in the original repository and as a URL in other repositories.
