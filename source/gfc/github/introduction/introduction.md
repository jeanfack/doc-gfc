Which of the following is an example of a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
* {bdg-success}`Correct` Git
* **Subversion (SVN)**: SVN is a centralized version control system where there is a single central repository that contains the entire version history of the project.\
Developers typically check out a working copy from the central repository, make changes, and then commit those changes back to the central repository.\
Unlike distributed version control systems (DVCS) such as Git and Mercurial, SVN does not provide each user with a full copy of the repository.\
Instead, users interact with the central repository for version control activities.
* **Concurrent Versions System (CVS)**: CVS is one of the older version control systems that operates on a centralized model.\
It allows multiple developers to access a central repository, but it lacks some of the advanced features and capabilities found in more modern version control systems.
* **Perforce (Helix Core)**: Perforce is a version control system that uses a centralized model.\
It is commonly used for managing large codebases and is known for its scalability.\
Users interact with a central server to perform version control operations.
* **Microsoft Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)**: TFVC is a version control system provided by Microsoft as part of the Team Foundation Server (TFS) or Azure DevOps Services.\
It operates in a centralized manner, with a central repository storing the version history.
