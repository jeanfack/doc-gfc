### Primary Purpose

::::{grid}
:::{grid-item-card}
What is a security policy in GitHub ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Define guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Give people instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities in your project.\

::::{grid}
:::{grid-item-card}
What does the concept of **shifting left** refer to in the context of secure development ?
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
Integrating security measures earlier in the development lifecycle.
:::
